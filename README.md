currently very wip

a thing for reading things on thread based websites like

-   reddit (wip)
-   twitter (planned, who knows)
-   mastodon (planned, who knows)

demo: https://thread.pfg.pw/reddit

note that "Enhanced Tracking Prevention" in firefox must be disabled for the demo to
work. Firefox tracking prevention indiscriminately bans all requests to social media
sites.

this could be fixed in the future with a proxy site
