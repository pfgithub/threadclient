## new features reddit doesn't have

- "threaded replies" to decrease indentation ([some examples in this thread](https://thread.pfg.pw/reddit/r/woooosh/comments/lcd26e/these_people_always_misunderstand_everything/))
- ability to preview links in comments like RES adds
- ability to preview comments written in markdown mode before posting them
- all external links open in a new tab by default so you never have to worry if you should click or ctrl click a link
- usernames are different colors to make it easier to notice repeat users
- threadreader preview supports these better than reddit in some ways:
  - imgur albums
  - gfycat gifs
  - twitch clips
- threadreader displays braille images correctly even if the author of the post formatted them incorrectly
