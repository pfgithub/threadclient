// drag and drop ui builder
// the goal is to make it support like any component you want
// we'll see
// and it should be designed for either imgui or solid js reactive output
// so like for lists you can make a list item spec and it just makes a component
// and you can add holes to the list that are filled in with code eg

// oh yeah and no constraints. constraints are horrible. use flex/grid instead.
