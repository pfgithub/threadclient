// ok we get to pick:
// should we recieve:
// - all events related to a document
// or:
// - only events related to anything we subscribe to

// choices:
// - all events means that the app won't work as well with large documents but
//   significantly simplifies stuff
// - only events we subscribe to is nice but i think it makes the reconcile() function
//   in app_data harder
//   - oh this would be really slow wouldn't it. we'd ask for keys and then based on
//     the result ask for more data and then it would end up not being very good
//
// ok so thinking about all events:
// - change everything into an action. so when you reconcile, it appends a batch of
//   actions to the action list
// - when we recieve an event from the server, we apply the action
//
// - ok so I'm going to reorganize app_data around actions and then we can start
//   working with the server probably
