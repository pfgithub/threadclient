collaborative editing:

we'll back it with mongodb which gives change notifications i think

then we can have a server that connects to the database and sends events to clients

either this or we can use firebase. this will be harder but also i need to learn how
to do distributed stuff and it will be very useful because i can reuse it for interpunct
and other things
