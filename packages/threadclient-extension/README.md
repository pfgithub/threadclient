before release:

- [ ] require few permissions on install (perms to manage thread.pfg.pw)
- [ ] options page

features I want:

- [x] auto redirect to thread.pfg.pw
- [ ] click the icon to search for reddit comments on a youtube video
- [ ] do that for lots of pages, not just youtube
- [ ] proxy getting reddit chat message count and pass to threadclient (fixes an issue)
  - this should be enabled by default (no going into settings and accepting an extra permission)
  - gql
  - url: `https://gql.reddit.com/?request_timestamp=${unix timestamp}`
  - body: `{id "d99f8962bcd6"}`
  - authorization: `Bearer ${â€¦}`
    - i'm not sure where that token is from. the first bit is in the `reddit_session` cookie but where's the
      part after the dash from? idk
  - response:
    ```js
    {data: {badgeIndicators: {
        chatUnreadMessages: {count: number},
        chatUnreadMentions: {count: number},
        chatHasNewMessages: {isShowing: boolean},
        chatUnacceptedInvites: {count: number},
    }}}
    ```
- [ ] proxy uploading images to reddit's s3 bucket if it's even possible. I think it is but haven't tested.

ok I think I have to do this to get it in my browser:
