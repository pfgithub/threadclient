before release:

- [ ] require few permissions on install (perms to manage thread.pfg.pw)
- [ ] options page

features I want:

- [x] auto redirect to thread.pfg.pw
- [ ] click the icon to search for reddit comments on a youtube video
- [ ] do that for lots of pages, not just youtube
- [ ] proxy getting reddit chat message count and pass to threadclient (fixes an issue)
- [ ] proxy uploading images to reddit's s3 bucket if it's even possible. I think it is but haven't tested.
