            // - write the code in a seperate file

            // if there's some other obvious and simple way to improve perf here, I'm not
            // sure what it is. there are some complex things I could do eg: splitting the scene into
            // chunks and only updating the chunks that are modified
            // depending on the size of the chunks, that may work to improve perf a bit. a
            // chunk with 1.4k vertices updates in ~16ms, although hopefully chunks would be closer
            // to like <500 vertices in which case it'd be quite fast. that's with a pretty small
            // chunk size and a lot of chunks have to be updated for large strokes, which could
            // be bad. and updating a chunk is:
            // 1. union the polygon with nothing (to optimize it).
            // 2. for each chunk in range: (note that chunks are slightly larger than squares to account for error)
            //    - and a rectangle a bit bigger than the chunk with the optimized polygon
            //    - union the result with the chunk content
            // who knows what the perf on that would be for long lines
            // and it'd be complicated and I'd rather do simple stuff first
            // - https://mourner.github.io/simplify-js/ here's something fun
            // - https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplify-geojson or this one
            //   if I ever want to try to recreate my infinite canvas program, I can do level of detail
            //   for chunks and stuff which could be neat. unfortunately, it will still suffer from
            //   floating point precision loss if you zoom out too far, but this would make it possible
            //   to do quite high performance edits probably
            // - note that simplify with a tolerance of 1 can multiply vertex count by ~0.6, which
            //   is pretty nice.

            // isn't that difficult, and start working on other parts of the animator
