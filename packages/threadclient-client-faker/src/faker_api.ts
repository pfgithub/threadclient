// the faker api gives you information:
// - since there's no point emulating a real api, the api
//   will just give enough info for the post to get generated.
// - that is:
//   - a faker seed
//   - the type of post being generated
// - faker.ts will only ever do faker() calls when it has a faker seed from the api available
